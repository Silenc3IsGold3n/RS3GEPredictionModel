To run you need python (this was done in python3) and pip. 
Then to grab the rest of the required python libraries just run: "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the directory with the rest of the files


Then whenever you wish to update your pricing just run the updateSpreadsheet.py


Please note that you can add as many new items to the top section, the spreadsheet itself should update along with the item information you add.
The script itself runs off the item IDs not the item name, to grab the item ID you can find it on grand exchange info of the item on runescape.wiki (e.g. https://runescape.wiki/w/Exchange:Dark_arrow) 


If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or just want to chat hmu.
